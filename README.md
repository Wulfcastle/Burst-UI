A Redesign of the Burst UI


How to Install :

1. Download this repo to your PC
2. Navigate to the root of your Burst folder, e.g. C:\Burst\burst_1.0.0
3. Copy and Paste the "html" folder from this repo over the existing "html" folder in your Burst root folder, overwriting previous files.



Note :

This redesign only changes the CSS & HTML files that are used on the front-end of the NRS server that runs Burst, no back-end code has
been edited, nor has any of the core functionality been edited in any way.
